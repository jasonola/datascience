Welcome to my github profile ! Let me guide you through my files and projects !

## [Python Data Analysis](https://github.com/jasonola/datascience/tree/master/python_data_analysis)

Here you will find 2 folders, one with beginners level data wrangling and the other is more advanced.

[Beginner notebook](https://github.com/jasonola/datascience/tree/master/python_data_analysis/beginner_data_wrangling) : you will find a notebook where I do my first data wranglings, I read in the csv file, do some data cleaning, get insights and finally visualise results. The project was analysing the happiness of countries dataset.

[Advanced notebook](https://github.com/jasonola/datascience/tree/master/python_data_analysis/advanced_data_wrangling) : I do data wrangling on a much bigger and messy dataset that you can download here : [openfoods dataset](en.openfoodfacts.org.products.tsv)
For this project I had to find ways of cleaning the very messy data, choosing the right amount of data to keep or toss, how to replace missing/outlying data... All of this is outlined in details in the notebook.
