# datascience

Welcome to my github profile ! I'm Jason Ola, student at Universit√© de Lausanne in Computer Science and Geography, and EPFL extension school alumni. In this repository you will find the work I've done so far during my studies at uni, EPFL and personal projects regarding Data Science. I will be describing the folders in the same order as I completed the projects, and I intended to showcase my project the way I completed it at the time so you can see my overall improvements.

Let me guide you through my files and projects !

## [Python Data Analysis](https://github.com/jasonola/datascience/tree/master/python_data_analysis)

Techs : Python, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn, sqlite3
Skills covered : data import, data cleaning, missing values handling, statistical summaries, data wrangling, regular expressions, data visualisation, database manipulation

[Beginner notebook](https://github.com/jasonola/datascience/tree/master/python_data_analysis/beginner_data_wrangling) : My first data wranglings, I read in the csv file, do some data cleaning, get insights and finally visualise results. The project was analysing the happiness of countries dataset.

[Advanced notebook](https://github.com/jasonola/datascience/tree/master/python_data_analysis/advanced_data_wrangling) : I do data wrangling on a much bigger and messy dataset that you can download here : [openfoods dataset](en.openfoodfacts.org.products.tsv)
For this project I had to find ways of cleaning the very messy data, choosing the right amount of data to keep or toss, how to replace missing/outlying data... All of this is outlined in details in the notebook.

## [Python Machine Learning](https://github.com/jasonola/datascience/tree/master/python_ml)

Techs : Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, flask, pyAudioAnalysis, keras
Skills covered : data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, data visualisation, insights, use of sk-learn pipes/grid search, regression, classification, unsupervised learning, neural networks

This is where I showcase my work in machine learning with Python

In the [Regression](https://github.com/jasonola/datascience/tree/master/python_ml/regression) file, you will see my first touch with ML as I implement a simple regression model with numpy in the [beginner ML](https://github.com/jasonola/datascience/blob/master/python_ml/regression/initial_ml_exercices/beginner_ml.ipynb) file. I also use my first sk-learn objects.
In the more advanced [regression](https://github.com/jasonola/datascience/blob/master/python_ml/regression/regression/regression_project.ipynb) file I work on the Boston house price dataset. I start by doing some EDA to inform myself of the data, what is missing, what I should encode differently. My thought process is thoroughly explained throughout the notebook. I did multiple models : simple (fed with 2 most important features), intermediate (fed with 20 important features) and complex (fed with all features).

In the [classification](https://github.com/jasonola/datascience/tree/master/python_ml/classification) folder I work on a classification task to classify 6 different types of vehicles. I started working with multiple files to separate my work better so it can be clearer
